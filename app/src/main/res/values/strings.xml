        <item>Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes,
            endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not medically supported. On average,
            obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their normal counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass.</item>
